            <h3>
                A long time ago I was addicted to soap, but I'm clean now. 
            </h3>

            <p>This project is a collection of bizarre, unrelated topics: jokes about soap, a list of minor league baseball team names, halloween movie recommendations, an unofficial ranking of CoMo pizza restaurants and a photo gallery taking viewers along with me to my first Chelsea FC match.</p>
            <p>Still, these topics are a glimpse into my life. It's a collection of the things that bring me joy. I mean, who doesn't love goofy baseball team names, pizza, halloween movies, and a photo gallery that includes a dog? So, thank you for taking part in my life, through these web pages.</p>
            <p>The decisions I made to create these pages are simple. I aimed for a clean layout that was bright, bubbly and inviting, without being too "in your face." While I played with multiple color schemes, the theme I initially picked for my pizza page seemed to make the most sense – not because I want my project to shout "Pizza!", but because it allows for a smooth experience across the pages. The colors make it so that none of the pages owns the theme more than another.</p>
            <p>I hope that you enjoy my favorite Halloween classics, my trip to Soldier Field and the other random topics that give insight into my life, particularly over the past 6 months. And, I hope that you enjoy the navigation, the fonts and the photos – I sure enjoyed putting it all together.</p>
